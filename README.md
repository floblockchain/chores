# chores
Just to use the issue tracker and agile project management of github

1. Fix the damn wiki (https://wiki.flo.cash/index.php/Main_Page). It is being attacked by a bot. We need to either move it, or fix the software that runs it so that changes need to be approved. I understand we don't want to centralize that control, but we also don't want to destroy the entire wiki project for the sake of decentralization. This is a baby of mine, since I put all the work in to create it.

2. Update the website. Forget the a massive overhaul at this point. Let's just update the links and the text. Example: get rid of the Florincoin reference on the Documentation page. Bury the tZERO references since they are no longer using FLO (or at least suspended their use). Update the exchanges to include Abra, etc. Eliminate references to things that happened in 2019 and update it with things that happened in 2020.

3. Move the website to a new domain (move away from "cash")?
